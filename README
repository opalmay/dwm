My very own build of dwm :)
Might be usefull to others - some patches required a fair amount of manual patching and bug fixing.
Especially with Singletagset. that thing does not mix well with other patches.
The following patches are included:
singletagset
removeborder
vanitygaps (some layouts/gaps functions in commects)
cfacts
fullscreen
statuscmd (from luke's build)
pertag
taglabels
bartabgroups
winicon
alwayscenter
systray
adjacenttag
tag then view function
fixed border transparency (from alpha patch)
colorbar
statusallmons
hide vacant tags

Probably some others I've missed
